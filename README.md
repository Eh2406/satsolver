# smtsolver

## Development

To run the development environment, you need to start the frontend dev server:

**Terminal - Frontend Dev Server:**

```bash
yarn dev
```

This starts the Vite development server (typically on `http://localhost:5173`)

## Build

To build the frontend for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory.
